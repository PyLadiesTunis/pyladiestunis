We are a group of Tunisian women developers who love the Python programming language. We are part of the [Pyladies](http://pyladies.com/) global community.

Our mission is to promote, educate and advance a diverse Python community through outreach, education, conferences, events and social gatherings.

Everyone is welcome to join our [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/pyladies-tunis/) group to be notified about our next activities.
